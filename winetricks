#
# Winetricks is a package manager for Win32 dlls and applications on POSIX.
# Features:
# - Consists of a single shell script - no installation required
# - Downloads packages automatically from original trusted sources
# - Points out and works around known wine bugs automatically
# - Both command-line and GUI operation
# - Can install many packages in silent (unattended) mode
# - Multiplatform; written for Linux, but supports OS X and Cygwin too
#
# Uses the following non-POSIX system tools:
# - wine is used to execute Win32 apps except on Cygwin.
# - ar, cabextract, unrar, unzip, and 7z are needed by some verbs.
# - aria2c, wget, curl, or fetch is needed for downloading.
# - sha256sum, sha256, or shasum (OSX 10.5 does not support these, 10.6+ is required):
#   note: some legacy verbs may still use sha1sum, sha1, or shasum, but this is
#   deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
# - zenity is needed by the GUI, though it can limp along somewhat with kdialog/xmessage.
# - xdg-open (if present) or open (for OS X) is used to open download pages
#   for the user when downloads cannot be fully automated.
# - sudo is used to mount .iso images if the user cached them with -k option.
# - perl is used to munge steam config files.
# - torify is used with option "--torify" if sites are blocked in single countries.
# On Ubuntu, the following lines can be used to install all the prerequisites:
#    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa
#    sudo apt-get update
#    sudo apt-get install binutils cabextract p7zip unrar unzip wget wine zenity
#
# See http://winetricks.org for documentation and tutorials, including
# how to contribute changes to winetricks.

#--------------------------------------------------------------------
# Coding standards:
#
# Portability:
# - Portability matters, as this script is run on many operating systems
# - No bash, zsh, or csh extensions; only use features from
#   the POSIX standard shell and utilities; see
#   http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/xcu_chap02.html
# - 'checkbashisms -p -x winetricks' should show no warnings (per Debian policy)
# - Prefer classic sh idioms as described in e.g.
#   "Portable Shell Programming" by Bruce Blinn, ISBN: 0-13-451494-7
# - If there is no universally available program for a needed function,
#   support the two most frequently available programs.
#   e.g. fall back to wget if curl is not available; likewise, support
#   both sha256sum and sha256.
# - When using Unix commands like cp, put options before filenames so it will
#   work on systems like OS X.  e.g. "rm -f foo.dat", not "rm foo.dat -f"
#
# Formatting:
# - Your terminal and editor must be configured for UTF-8
#   If you do not see an o with two dots over it here [ö], stop!
# - Do not use tabs in this file or any verbs.
# - Indent 4 spaces.
# - Try to keep line length below 80 (makes printing easier)
# - Open curly braces ('{'),
#   then should go on the same line as 'if/elif'
#   close curlies ('}') and 'fi' should line up with the matching { or if,
#   cases indented 4 spaces from 'case' and 'esac'.  For instance,
#
#      if test "$FOO" = "bar"; then
#         echo "FOO is bar"
#      fi
#
#      case "$FOO" in
#          bar) echo "FOO is still bar" ;;
#      esac
#
# Commenting:
# - Comments should explain intent in English
# - Keep functions short and well named to reduce need for comments
#
# Naming:
# Public things defined by this script, for use by verbs:
# - Variables have uppercase names starting with W_
# - Functions have lowercase names starting with w_
#
# Private things internal to this script, not for use by verbs:
# - Local variables have lowercase names starting with uppercase _W_
#   (and should not use the local declaration, as it is not POSIX)
# - Global variables have uppercase names starting with WINETRICKS_
# - Functions have lowercase names starting with winetricks_
# FIXME: A few verbs still use winetricks-private functions or variables.
#
# Internationalization / localization:
# - Important or frequently used message should be internationalized
#   so translations can be easily added.  For example:
#     case $LANG in
#         de*) echo "Das ist die deutsche Meldung" ;;
#         *)   echo "This is the English message" ;;
#     esac

# Brief HOWTO for adding a GOG game:
# - "beneath_a_steel_sky" is the installer exe name, minus "setup_" and ".exe"
# - "Beneath a Steel Sky" is installer window title, minus "Setup - "
# - There are no other files for this game, so this parameter is empty.
#   Otherwise it should be of the following form:
#   file_name[,length[,sha1sum]] [...]
# - "TsCheckBox4" is the control name for the checkbox deciding whether it will
#   install some reader (Foxit in this case, could be Acrobat Reader). That
#   installation is enabled by default, and would just bloat the generic
#   AutoHotKey script, so it gets disabled.
# - "ScummVM\\[...]" is the command line to run the game, as fetched from the
#   shortcut/launcher installer/wine creates, which will be used in BAT scripts
#   created by wisotool
# - The part in the URL which is specific to this game is identical to its "id"
#   (first parameter), so this parameter is left out.
# - The install directory is the same as installer window title (second
#   parameter), so this parameter is left out.
# - Main installer size and sha1sum, separated by a comma.
